			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Development Environment",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup into subtasks covering: 1) Repository initialization and git configuration, 2) Monorepo structure setup with workspaces, 3) TypeScript configuration for all packages, 4) Code quality tools setup (ESLint, Prettier), 5) Testing framework configuration, 6) Docker environment setup, 7) CI/CD pipeline configuration, 8) Documentation and README creation",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple technologies and configurations that need to work together. While each individual setup is straightforward, coordinating them in a monorepo with proper tooling requires careful planning and execution."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Database Models and Repository Layer",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for: 1) Prisma setup and configuration, 2) User and authentication models, 3) Pipeline core models with JSON storage, 4) Execution and tracking models, 5) File/output management models, 6) Repository interface definitions, 7) Repository implementations with Prisma, 8) Migration system setup, 9) Database seeding and fixtures, 10) Query optimization and indexing",
			"reasoning": "Database design is critical for the entire application. The complexity comes from designing flexible JSON storage for pipelines, handling relationships properly, implementing repository pattern correctly, and ensuring future PostgreSQL compatibility."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build Authentication and API Gateway Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) JWT implementation and token management, 2) Passport.js setup with strategies, 3) Auth middleware and route protection, 4) User registration and login endpoints, 5) Rate limiting and security middleware, 6) API versioning and structure, 7) Error handling and logging, 8) OpenAPI documentation setup, 9) Session management with Redis",
			"reasoning": "Authentication is complex due to security requirements, but well-documented patterns exist. The challenge is in properly implementing JWT with refresh tokens, rate limiting, and integrating with the rest of the infrastructure."

		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Pipeline Service and Node Registry System",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 11,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Pipeline service architecture and interfaces, 2) CRUD operations for pipelines, 3) Pipeline validation engine, 4) Node registry system design, 5) Base node implementations, 6) Node connection and type validation, 7) Pipeline versioning system, 8) Template management, 9) Import/export functionality, 10) Graph traversal utilities, 11) Pipeline metadata handling",
			"reasoning": "This is the core business logic with high complexity. It requires designing a flexible node system, implementing graph validation, ensuring type safety between connections, and building a robust versioning system."

		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate AI Service Providers",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for: 1) Provider interface design, 2) OpenAI integration implementation, 3) Stability AI integration, 4) Replicate provider setup, 5) Credential management system, 6) Rate limiting per provider, 7) Cost tracking implementation, 8) Error handling and fallbacks, 9) Streaming response support, 10) Provider health monitoring",
			"reasoning": "AI provider integration is complex due to different APIs, authentication methods, rate limits, and response formats. Building a unified interface while handling provider-specific quirks requires careful abstraction."
